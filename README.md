# brackets
A tournament management single page web application that utilizes the MERN stack, a RESTful API, and isomorphic rendering.

# how?
Node+Express to serve it up, making use of its advantages for SPAs and implementing a RESTful API.

MongoDB to store data.

React as the frontend framework. I am intentionally not using Redux as it adds complexity that I do not need (yet, maybe). I chose to use the 'styled-components' library to introduce CSS into the project.

Webpack to bundle up my modules and for the amazing webpack-dev-server.

NPM scripts are used as the build processes, check those out to see what I'm doing.

I'm using the Standard linting rules for esLint with the addition of the react ruleset.

Still early in development!
