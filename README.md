We use MongoDB to store data. Our data can be summed up in two collections, users and brackets.

Express server, once I figure that out.

React will be the front. Shouldn't need Redux for quite some time.

Webpack to package it up. Trying to take advantage of it's "get-your-bundle-as-small-as-physically-possible" abilities.

# okay, how do i use it?

Umm... I'm not sure yet.
