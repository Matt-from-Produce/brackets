# brackets
Tournament Management! Sign up! Sign in! Make a bracket! Annoy your friends and tell them that if they want to play in the tournament they have to use my poo app and ALSO pay $20!

# how?
We use bleeding-edge enhanced APIs to process pre-rendered heuristic algorithms giving you the full tournament experience you deserve.

# seriously:

We use MongoDB to store data. Our data can be summed up in two collections, users and brackets. To the surprise of no one, we'll use Mongoose to interact with it. The choice of MongoDB reflects the choice of React as the front of the application. It only seemed right.

A possible GraphQL/Relay/Redux situation is brewing... we'll see.

React will be the front. I am not inclined yet to introduce Redux. The components should be fairly simple in the beginning, therefore we won't really benefit from Redux. It is super cool though and it will be added eventually as the app grows.

We'll use Webpack to ship the code. Webpack is important for this project because we want the size of the application to be as small as we can get it. The tools within Webpack are very strong and definitely enhance the development experience with things like webpack-dev-server and the eval devtool for source-maps. Also hot module reload, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

# okay, how do i use it?

you don't yet :(
